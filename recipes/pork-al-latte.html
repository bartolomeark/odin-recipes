    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>When the weather gets a little colder, this pork al latte really hits the spot. Pork shoulder meat is braised in a crème fraîche sauce until amazingly tender and delicious. Serve on polenta with crisp sage leaves for garnish.</p>
    <h3>Recipe:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

            <li>2 slices bacon, coarsely chopped</li>
        
            <li>1 ½ pounds pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
        
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        
            <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
        
            <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        
            <li>1 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
        
            <li>½ cup creme fraiche</li>
        
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves</li>
        
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        
            <li>15 whole fresh sage leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe:</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li>Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil into a skillet, place over medium heat, and cook bacon, stirring often, until crisp and bacon fat has rendered into the skillet, about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Season pork cubes generously with salt and black pepper. Remove bacon from pan and set aside, reserving fat in pan. Turn heat to medium-high and brown pork pieces in bacon drippings until well browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer meat to a bowl, leaving pan drippings in skillet.</li>

            <li>Turn heat to medium and stir in chopped onion and a pinch of salt. Cook and stir onion until translucent and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic into onion and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>

            <li>Pour chicken broth and crème fraîche into onion mixture; whisk until smooth. Scrape up and dissolve any browned bits of food on the bottom of the skillet. Bring mixture to a simmer.</li>

            <li>Return bacon to sauce and stir in 2 tablespoons chopped sage. Place pork pieces into simmering sauce along with any accumulated juices from the meat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until meat is almost tender, about 1 hour.</li>

            <li>Raise heat to medium and cook uncovered until pan sauce reduces and thickens and meat is very tender, about 20 more minutes. Stir red pepper flakes into sauce; adjust seasonings to taste.</li>

            <li>Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat; drop whole sage leaves into hot oil and cook, lightly tossing leaves in oil, until crisp, 10 to 15 seconds. Drain sage leaves on paper towels and crumble over pork.</li>
    </ol>
